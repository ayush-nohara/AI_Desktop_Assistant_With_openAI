# AI_Desktop_Assistant_With_openAI

The project involves creating an AI Desktop Assistant using OpenAI and Python. It covers installing and
setting up the project environment, and coding a basic application. The assistant is designed to perform
various tasks, integrate OpenAI for advanced functionalities, and communicate effectively with users,
CodeWhisperer AI aims to improve productivity, providing a hands-on learning experience in Python programming.
It will interact with users through voice or text input, understanding their queries and executing
appropriate actions or providing relevant information using the capabilities of the OpenAI.
This assistant can perform various tasks like google search, wikipedia search, open any website,
tell date and time, music play, write email ,chat with the user or can perofrm any other chatting task the user says.
I have used OpenAI API to perform the chatting tasks and pyAudio library to take the user voice input.
Other than this, for the chatting facility, we have to use amazon code whisper toolkit.
